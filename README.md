| Project Link | Topics | Tools / Libraries | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| [MetroBeat(working title)](https://github.com/liddyjacob/MetroBeat) | Audio Visualization, Audio Signal Analysis, Machine Learning | Python(librosa, pytorch), Godot | A model built from the ground up to find the beats of a song - created after dissatisfaction with Librosas built in beat.beat\_track function. |
| [Mini C](https://github.com/liddyjacob/MiniC/tree/master) | Compilers, Abstract Synatx Trees, Programming Theory, Modular Design | C++14, Cmake | A graduate-level course project about implementing a custom programming language. Implements the MiniC Programming language specified by [Dr. Sutton](http://asutton.github.io/), professor of Compiler Design. |
| [OPAN Finder](https://github.com/liddyjacob/OPAN_Finder_Final) | Number Theory, Research, Parallel Processing, Optimization | C++11, CMake, GMP, NTL | Implementation of the algorithms described in my 2019 Research Paper. Optimization and Parallel processing alongside mathematical discovory allowed my algorithm to solve an unsolved problem in mathematics. |
| [Hive TableTob Game Implementation](https://github.com/liddyjacob/Hive_python) | Object Oriented Programming, Modularity | Base Python + Tkinter | Implementation of the Hive Board game from scratch, including graphics, rule enforcement, game state, end game detection.
